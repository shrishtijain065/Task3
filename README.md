# Task3
It's an image classification model.
🖼️🚀 Built an Image Classification Model on the CIFAR Dataset! 🧠📦

Excited to share that I’ve successfully developed an Image Classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset – a classic benchmark in computer vision! 📸

🔍 Project Highlights:

▫️Preprocessed and normalized 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels)

▫️Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras

▫️Achieved strong accuracy 

Implemented techniques like:
✅ Data augmentation
✅ Dropout regularization
✅ Batch normalization

🧪 Key Takeaways:

▫️Learned the impact of model architecture on performance

▫️Improved generalization with augmentation and regularization

▫️Visualized training progress and confusion matrix for deeper insights

This project was a huge step forward in my deep learning journey, and I’m already exploring CIFAR-100 and more complex architectures like ResNet and Transfer Learning next! 🔍💡
